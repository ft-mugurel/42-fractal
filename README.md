# 42 Fractal Project

The **Fractal** project is an exploration of mathematical visualization and graphical programming. The goal is to render visually stunning fractals, such as the Mandelbrot set or Julia set, using a graphical library like MiniLibX.

This project focuses on understanding complex numbers, iterative algorithms, and graphical rendering. You'll implement mathematical formulas to generate fractal patterns and create an interactive interface to zoom and navigate through the fractal images.

By completing this project, you'll gain hands-on experience with mathematical concepts, graphical programming, and creating visually appealing representations of complex systems.
